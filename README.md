### Description

Hi All,This is the first time i am uploding some of my code here , its a demo control which will allow your application to be made as a Trial version in few minutes

Just Place this Control and set its NofDays and NofTimes(how many time aplication will run) and sets its status property to Demo

And provide yoour trial Expiration code on DemoCreator1_DemoCompleted event to handle the execution when demo expired

Rest is automatically handeld by this control
